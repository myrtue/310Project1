**Important note on running the java project**

When trying to call "java SearchMap input output", please be inside the /bin folder and use 
the notation "java Project1.SearchMap input_file output_file". This is because of the renamed package from default.


Also, I added a /lib directory that contains proper .jar files so that JUnit can run properly in the terminal.

Another final note--tried to remove the DS_Store files from the repo using the .gitignore, but it wouldn't work. The file itself is harmless, it is a product of the Mac OS.
